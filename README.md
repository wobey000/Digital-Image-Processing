Image Processing Library created in C++

Reference: Udemy: Practical Image Processing in C/C ++ From Ground Upâ„¢   

## Things I've learned so far: 
 - Operations are done on each pixel but we might take into account the neighborhood for certain operations 
 - BMP image range is from 0-255 We can normalize if need be by the normalization equation or just make a hard max and min 
 - Operations like translation, rotation, reflection, scale, etc. are special cases of the affine transformation matrix
 - Linear Filtering uses a mask and slides the kernal over the image (hopefully I'm saying that right)
 - Linear Spacial Filtering is basically convolution 
 - Linear Filtering Steps: Define filter kernel -> Slide kernel over image -> Multiply pixels under the kernel by weights -> Copy resulting value to same location in new image
